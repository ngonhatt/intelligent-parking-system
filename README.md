# 🚗 Intelligent Parking System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an Intelligent Parking Management System that automates
vehicle entry and exit using RFID and image processing.
The system combines embedded firmware, hardware control, and a PC-based
management interface.

## 🔧 System Components
- RFID Reader
- USB Camera
- Servo Motor (Barrier control)
- Embedded controller
- PC-based monitoring software
- Excel file for vehicle data storage

---

## ⚙️ Features
- RFID card scanning for vehicle identification
- Automatic image capture on card scan
- License plate recognition
- Automatic and manual barrier control
- Vehicle entry and exit counting
- Registration and deregistration of parking cards
- Safety logic to prevent barrier closing when a vehicle is detected

---

## 🧠 System Workflow
1. RFID card is scanned
2. System verifies vehicle registration
3. Camera captures vehicle image
4. Barrier opens if authorized
5. Vehicle count is updated
6. Barrier closes after vehicle passes

## 🛠️ Software & Tools
- Embedded C / C++
- Serial communication
- Image processing
- PC-based control interface
- Excel-based data management
